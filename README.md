  ## Description

  Built the application from scratch that uses inquirer and mysql to be able to do things from the inquirer prompt. Depending on the responses you get back from the inquirer prompt we use the mysql package to query from the database and get back the results. Whether that be viewing the employee list or adding an employee.
